# 🏠 Allotment Module - Complete Documentation

## Overview

The Allotment Module manages the assignment of properties to customers in the PMS system. It enforces the critical business rule: **1 Property = 1 Customer**.

---

## 📋 Module Features

### 1. Create Allotment (`/Allotment/Create`)

**Workflow:**

#### Step 1: Search Customer
- Enter Customer ID and click Search
- System validates:
  - ✅ Customer exists
  - ✅ Customer status is "Active"
  - ✅ Customer does NOT already have a property
  - ✅ Customer has a Payment Plan assigned

**Error Messages:**
- "Customer not found with ID: XXXX"
- "Customer is not Active. Current Status: {Status}"
- "Customer already has a property allotted"
- "Customer does not have a Payment Plan assigned"

#### Step 2: Select Property
- System automatically loads available properties filtered by:
  - ✅ Property Status = "Available"
  - ✅ Property Size = Customer's Registered Size
  - ✅ Property Project = Customer's Payment Plan Project

**Smart Filtering Example:**
- Customer Registered Size: "10 Marla"
- Customer Plan Project: "PROJECT001"
- Result: Only shows 10 Marla properties in PROJECT001 that are Available

**Error Messages:**
- "No available properties found matching Size: {Size} in Project: {Project}"

#### Step 3: Complete Allotment
- Select Allotment Type:
  - Regular
  - Transfer
  - Balloting
  - Special

- Add Comments (Optional)
- Upload Attachment (Optional)
  - Supported formats: PDF, JPG, PNG, DOC, DOCX
  - Stored in: `/wwwroot/uploads/allotments/`

**On Submit:**
1. Creates new Allotment record with unique ID (ALLOT00001)
2. Updates Property Status from "Available" to "Allotted"
3. Saves attachment (if provided)
4. Logs activity in ActivityLog table
5. Redirects to Property Details page

---

### 2. Un-Allot Property (`/Allotment/UnAllot`)

**Features:**
- View all current allotments in a table
- See property details, customer details, dates, status
- Un-allot (cancel) an allotment with reason

**Un-Allot Process:**
1. Click "Un-Allot" button

3. Enter reason for un-allotment (required)
4. Confirm action

**On Confirm:**
1. Deletes Allotment record

**⚠️ Warning:** Un-allotment is permanent and cannot be undone!

## 🎯 Business Rules Enforced

### 1. One Property = One Customer
- Database: UNIQUE constraint on `Allotment.PropertyID`
- Code: Validation checks before creating allotment
- UI: Error messages prevent duplicate allotments

### 2. One Customer = One Property
- Code: Checks if customer already has allotment
- UI: Shows error if customer already has property
- Solution: Create new customer entry for additional properties

### 3. Size Matching
- Properties shown must match customer's registered size
- Prevents wrong-sized property allotment
- Ensures customer gets what they paid for

### 4. Project Matching
- Properties shown must be in customer's plan project
- Prevents cross-project allotments
- Maintains project integrity

### 5. Status Validation
- Customer must be "Active"
- Property must be "Available"
- Prevents allotment to inactive/suspended customers

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Multiple Properties for Same Person

**Wrong Approach:** ❌
- Assign multiple properties to same CustomerID

**Correct Approach:** ✅
- Create NEW Customer entry
- Use NEW RegistrationID
- Assign NEW Payment Plan
- Link to same person but different membership

**Why?**
- One Registration = One Payment Plan = One Property
- Keeps payment tracking clean
- Maintains business logic integrity

### Un-Allotment Impact

When you un-allot:
- ✅ Property becomes available again
- ✅ Customer can be assigned new property
- ✅ Allotment record is deleted (not archived)
- ⚠️ Action cannot be undone

**Best Practice:** 
- Use un-allot only when absolutely necessary
- Document reason thoroughly
- Consider using Transfer module instead if changing ownership

## 📊 Example Workflow

### Scenario: Allotting Property to New Customer

**Customer Details:**
- Customer ID: CUST005
- Name: John Doe
- Status: Active
- Registered Size: 10 Marla
- Payment Plan: Plan001 (Project: Juba Smart City Phase 1)

**Steps:**
1. Admin searches for CUST005
2. System validates: ✅ Active, ✅ No existing property, ✅ Has plan
3. System loads properties: 10 Marla plots in Phase 1 that are Available
4. Admin selects Plot PROP001 (Block A, 10 Marla)
5. Selects type: "Regular"
6. Adds comment: "First allotment to customer"
7. Uploads NOC document
8. Clicks Allot

**Result:**
- Allotment ALLOT00001 created
- PROP001 status: Available → Allotted
- Document saved to `/uploads/allotments/`
- Activity logged
- Admin redirected to Property Details page

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Customer already has a property allotted"
**Solution:** 
- Check if this is correct
- If customer needs another property, create new customer entry
- Use different RegistrationID for the new membership

### "No available properties found"
**Causes:**
- No properties match customer's size
- No properties in customer's project
- All matching properties already allotted

**Solution:**
- Add more properties to the project
- Check customer's registered size is correct
- Check property sizes are correctly entered

### "Property is not available"
**Causes:**
- Property already allotted to another customer
- Property status is not "Available"

**Solution:**
- Un-allot the property first (if appropriate)
- Check property status
- Use different property
